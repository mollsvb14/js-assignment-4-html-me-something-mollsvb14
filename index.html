      <h2>5. Would've, Could've, Should've</h2>
      <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">This song truly embodies the feeling of regretting your first love that turns out
         to be toxic, but we are too blind by young love to see it. "Give me back 
         girlhood it was mine first,", this lyric is so powerful in showing how your youth can 
         be ruined over a bad relationship.

      <h2>4. Champagne Problems </h2>
      <p>This song to me talks of a picture perfect couple that has their whole
         life planned out for them, but it's not all that it seems. Two people who were
         just not good for each other, and when it came time to make the next steps in
         life, she wasn't ready. "love slipped beyond your reaches and I couldn't give a reason
         Champagne Problems.".

         <h2>3. Cardigan</h2>
         <p>Wow, this song just gives me all the feelings. To me, this song 
            is about finding someone who sees your worth after struggling with not feeling
            enough to someone, which is beautiful. On the other hand, it also speaks of first
            heartbreak which a lot of people can relate to the pain of that. Overtime, it also talks 
            of finally healing from that heartbreak, "And when I felt like I was an old Cardigan
            under someone's bed, you put on and said I was your favorite."

         <h2>2. Cruel Summer</h2>
         <p>To be honest, the lyrics don't speak to me as much as the music does in this song.
            The bridge in this is just so much fun to sing to in the shower or in the car with
            the windows down. "And I scream 'For whatever it's worth I love you, ain't that the worst
            thing you ever heard?""

         <h2>1. All Too Well(10 Minute Version)(Taylor's Version)</h2>
         <p>This masterpiece of a song tells a whole story. Thinking you're
            in love with someone but them not reciprocating it back, the isolating
            feeling of not being treated correctly all plays out in this song. Taylor paints
            such a beautiful and sarrowful setting as she recounts her short relationship with
            someone who never showed his true feelings and treated her poorly. "And you call me up
            again just to break me like a promise, so casually cruel in the name of being honest."
